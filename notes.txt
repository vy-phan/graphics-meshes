Assignment 5

I enjoyed this assignment very much actually. The most challenging task was to understand the process of making a sphere. Since the sphere has its triangles stitched from top to bottom and the triangle orientation is flipped, it took me a while to correctly connect the correct vertices for the correct triangles.

Thomas Rigger, as always, helped me out. We learned and understood more by discussing the concept of the project, which is both fun and helpful.
